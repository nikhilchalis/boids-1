# boids-1
implementation of boids with obstacle avoidance

Started off as a basic boids implementation, then evolved when I added some basic functionality 
Left/primary click to place a boid on screen
Right/secondary click to place an obstacle on screen (large red circle)

Avoidance is not perfect since there is no collision detection implemented - my avoidance function is essentially modelling a repulsive force like two electrons would feel
